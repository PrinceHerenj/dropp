        <li> How Dropp Functions

        Dropp employs a <b>quantity-based pricing system</b> to determine the shipping costs, making it affordable for students while ensuring transparency in charges. Upon placing an order, students can track their delivery in real-time through the app, which provides an estimated time of arrival, ensuring that deliveries occur within the specified timeframe.

        This system addresses the common <b>logistics challenges</b> faced by students, such as long walks and queuing at the gate to collect their packages. By handling these tasks, Dropp significantly reduces the burden on students, allowing them to focus on their studies and other activities. The convenience of having items delivered directly to their rooms saves valuable time that would otherwise be spent navigating through campus.

        In addition, Dropp collaborates with reliable delivery partners who are trained to meet strict timelines, ensuring that every package arrives promptly. This commitment to timely delivery enhances the overall experience for students, making it a hassle-free process. All of this is provided at a cost that remains competitive and reasonable, making Dropp an essential service for every student at NIT Warangal.
